Business Goal:

Its 2015 and the stakeholder wants to invest in advertisements in a baseball stadium, and would potentially like to strike a brand deal with a high performing player on the team, ideally someone of mvp or all star status.

During the analysis, the stakeholder in question is curious as to what, if any, game statistics may impact the turnout of audience for a particular season. Additionally, a visual of audience trends may assist in the stakeholders foresight when making a decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Plan:

I will make use of past 5 season's (~2010-2014) data to predict the most suitable team for the stakeholder to invest. I'll then join datasets to find average attendance per team (home_game.csv + team.csv), and number of award winning players on said team (player_award.csv + appearances.csv + player.csv + team.csv), and present my findings with a list of a few teams that score highest based on the given metrics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sourcing + Cleaning Data:

Source used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seanlahman/the-history-of-baseball?select=salary.csv
(History of Baseball Kaggle dataset 2015 by Sean Lahman)

datasets not too large, so cleaned in a spreadsheet. started by removing extraneous columns, fixed team_ids to reflect official MLB team acronyms for consistency

In cleaning, I have limited datasets to the following columns (variables):
team.csv - year, team_id (primkey), name, park
player_award.csv - player_id (primkey), award_id, year
home_game.csv - year, team_id (primkey), games, attendance
player.csv - player_id (primkey), name_first, name_last, *name_full
appearances.csv - year, team_id, player_id (primkey)

All sheets have been filtered to only include active data within the timeframe of 2010 to 2014. Appearances uses data solely from 2014 to determine the most up-to-date association of players for later analysis.

Analysis Documentation:

1. Identify teams with highest average ticket sales in the past 5 years, as well as teams with the highest number of award-winning players.

x-load cleaned data into bigquery
x-create a query that combines home_game.csv + team.csv with an inner join on team_id
x-add calculated column for attendance/games to get average home game attendance during 2010-2014 grouped by team. sort by this metric to find roughly the top 10 best selling teams.

Combining findings by team_ids:
```
SELECT star_players.star_players AS star_players,
  tickets.average_attendance AS avg_attendance
FROM exproj-1.Baseball.star_players
JOIN exproj-1.Baseball.tickets
ON star_players.team=tickets.name
```
-> stars_vs_attendance.csv

-visuals using tableau + presentation




2. Determine what game factors (if any) get people buying tickets.

A suitable correlation coefficient is at least +- 0.7
Star players is not a good metric, 0.205019 coefficient is relatively low.

I will use the uncleaned teams.csv file to compare popular game metrics against average attendance on the basis of correlation coefficients.

This process is outlined in proj.html along with a resulting visual using R to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.




3. Check trends in average attendance over years 2010-2014

Calculated the average attendance per game for each team over 2010-2014, joined with overall average attendance metric.

```
SELECT parks.year,
  parks.team_id,
  CAST(parks.attendance/parks.games AS INT64) AS avg_attendance
FROM `exproj-1.Baseball.parks` AS parks
```

Plotted Average Attendance vs. Year with a filter for overall average attendance from all 5 years.
