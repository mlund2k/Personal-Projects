## Objective

**Goal:** Clean and analyze data to determine suitable teams for an advertisement firm, determine which if any key performance indicators lead to an increase in attendance for advertising purposes.

**Business Prompt:** 
1. Its 2015 and the stakeholder wants to invest in advertisements in a baseball stadium, and would potentially like to strike a brand deal with a high performing player on the team, ideally someone of mvp or all star status. Determine the most suitable team based on these metrics.
2. During the analysis, the stakeholder in question is curious as to what, if any, game statistics may impact the turnout of audience for a particular season. Additionally, a visual of audience trends may assist in the stakeholders foresight when making a decision.
